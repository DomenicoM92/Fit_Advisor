<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

FitAdvisor is intended to be a unified platform where every person can have all information needed for training in autonomous way.

With FitAdvisor you can have:
* Exercises divided by category
* Healthy food and muscular problems related recipes
* Possible injuries related to specific exercises or muscular group
* Available training assets for each exercise.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue with the tag.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
